## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing cutting-edge technologies for causal inference and the robust representation of digital evidence. The aim is to establish clear causal links within digital footprints, thereby increasing their reliability and probative value in legal contexts, ensuring digital evidence can stand up to scrutiny in court.

### Key Features

* **Causal Modeling of Digital Events:** Identifying cause-and-effect relationships within digital data.
* **Evidence Representation:** Developing methods for clear and unambiguous representation of digital evidence.
* **Probative Value Enhancement:** Strengthening the legal weight and reliability of digital evidence.
* **Automated Proof Generation:** Exploring automated methods for constructing evidentiary arguments.

### Goals

* Enhance the trustworthiness and legal admissibility of digital evidence.
* Provide a structured framework for interpreting complex digital forensic findings.
* Bridge the gap between raw digital data and its legal significance.
