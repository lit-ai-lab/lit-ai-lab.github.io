## Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the complex process of analyzing digital forensics evidence. The goal is to build a system that can intelligently extract, interpret, and present relevant information from various digital artifacts, significantly reducing manual effort and accelerating investigative timelines.

### Key Features

* **Automated Evidence Parsing:** Intelligent extraction of data from diverse digital sources.
* **Contextual Analysis:** LLM-driven understanding of evidence in the broader investigative context.
* **Report Generation:** Automated generation of concise and accurate forensics reports.
* **Scalability:** Designed to handle large volumes of digital evidence efficiently.

### Goals

* Improve the speed and accuracy of digital forensics investigations.
* Reduce the burden on human forensic analysts.
* Provide a comprehensive and actionable overview of digital evidence.
