## Project Overview

This research project aims to develop an AI system that can automatically detect and classify abnormalities in medical images, helping radiologists make faster and more accurate diagnoses.

### Key Features

- Multi-modal image analysis (X-ray, CT, MRI)
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Confidence scoring for predictions
- HIPAA-compliant data handling
- Integration with hospital PACS systems

### Research Goals

- Achieve 95%+ accuracy in anomaly detection
- Reduce diagnosis time by 50%
- Provide explainable AI insights
- Support rare disease identification

### Collaboration

This project is conducted in partnership with Seoul National University Hospital and has received IRB approval for clinical validation studies.
