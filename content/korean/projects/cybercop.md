## Project Overview

This ambitious project aims to build a comprehensive integrated system that assists cybercrime investigators in the complex process of solving cybercrimes. It focuses on developing sophisticated AI-driven reasoning and verification capabilities to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and validate hypotheses, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of cybercrime investigations.

### Key Features

* **Automated Scenario Generation:** Constructing crime scenarios based on gathered evidence.
* **Hypothesis Generation & Testing:** AI-driven formulation and verification of investigative hypotheses.
* **Evidence Correlation:** Identifying crucial links between disparate pieces of evidence.
* **Traceability & Auditability:** Ensuring transparency and verifiability of AI-generated insights.

### Goals

* Significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of cybercrime investigations.
* Provide robust, AI-driven support for investigators in complex cases.
* Reduce the time required to identify and apprehend cybercriminals.
