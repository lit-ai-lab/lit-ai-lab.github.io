## Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence to automate and enhance the analysis of self-audit results for the Board of Audit and Inspection. The goal is to develop AI-driven methods that can efficiently process large volumes of audit data, identify anomalies, patterns, and potential issues, thereby improving the accuracy and effectiveness of audit operations.

### Key Features

* **Automated Data Processing:** Efficiently ingesting and structuring diverse audit data.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying discrepancies or unusual patterns that may indicate risks.
* **Insight Generation:** Providing auditors with actionable insights derived from AI analysis.
* **Efficiency Enhancement:** Reducing manual effort and accelerating the audit cycle.

### Goals

* Improve the efficiency and quality of audit result analysis.
* Provide advanced tools to support auditors in their critical work.
* Contribute to more robust and data-driven public sector oversight.
